# E-commerce-Platform

This project aims to develop an E-commerce platform where small and large businesses can build an online store and sell their products on the web. This platform is completely hosted in the cloud, which means anyone can access it from any device that is connected to the internet may it be a phone or computer. I will personally handle all kinds of software upgrades and maintenance on behalf of my clients, hence giving them an opportunity to run their businesses from anywhere.
The regular businessman/woman requires a large number of tools to be able to manage their inventory, payments, and shipping, which results to them spending a lot of time and money all together. However with this platform I will integrate all the tools needed to run a business online successfully. This platform will not just be a piece of software that sells a single product but instead it will be an all-in-one e-commerce platform, with a rich ecosystem that will provide a new marketplace for business owners by bringing together buyers and sellers with a shared pursuit to make e-commerce better for everyone.
By doing so I will be making entrepreneurship much more accessible to anyone seeking to revolutionize their business. Whether it’s a small retailer or wholesaler trying to find their footing to access customers from different parts of the world. 
To begin selling on this platform, you’ll need to add products to your account, and set up a payment processor such as m-pesa. Then, you can choose where you want to sell your products whether it's by building an online store or selling on social media. To get people to buy from you, you’ll need to market your store so shoppers can visit your site and learn about your brand and products.
